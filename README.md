# SW-MCU-STM32-LORA-051

This is a test code for checking comminications for Lora modules (Ebyte E220D-90QT22D) with STM32 microcontrollers.



In this demo you can choose the character that you want to send with a potentiometer 0.96 Inch ST7735 LCD and pressing button to send.

Also I added a button to erase. Received text also will be displayed in the LCD.
